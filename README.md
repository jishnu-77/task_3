SQL Database Exploration and Manipulation

This project involves working with six SQL tables populated from corresponding CSV files. The primary focus is on understanding and exploring the data using SQL queries, and manipulating it through various types of JOIN operations.
Project Overview

    Data Population: Six tables were created and populated using CSV files.
    Data Exploration:
        SELECT and WHERE clauses were used to query and filter specific records.
    Data Manipulation:
        Various JOIN operations (LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and INNER JOIN) were applied to combine data from multiple tables based on logical relationships.

Key Concepts Practiced

    Table creation and data insertion
    Querying with SELECT and filtering with WHERE
    Combining tables using different types of JOINs
    Understanding relational database structures

Files Included

    SQL script file for table creation and data insertion
    CSV files for each of the six tables
    Example SQL queries for data exploration and manipulation

How to Run

    Import the SQL file into your preferred database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    Load the CSV files into the respective tables.
    Run the provided SQL queries to explore and manipulate the data.
